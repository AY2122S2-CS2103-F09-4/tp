3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your ReadyBakey.

5. Run the command `java -jar readybakey.jar`  (i.e., run the command in the same folder as the jar file) 

6. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

7. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

  * **`listo`** : Lists all orders.

  * **`addp`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25` : Adds a customer named `John Doe` to ReadyBakey’s contact list together with the necessary phone number, email and address.

## Features <a name="features"></a>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Command keywords i.e. `addo` `editp`, has to be in lowercase.
  e.g. `addo ...` is an acceptable keyword, but `ADDO..` is not acceptable.

* Prefixes used in command input has to be in lowercase.
  e.g. `add n/NAME...`, uses `n/` but `N/` is not acceptable.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `listo`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

### Using Natural Dates <a name="natural-dates"></a>

In order to provide a quicker method of referring to near dates, ReadyBakey allows users to use natural dates to refer to the directly upcoming days of the week.
The closest upcoming date that corresponds to the natural date's day input will be used. The time in HH:MM must still be provided by the user, along with the natural date.

This can be used in any command where dates are required, such as `incompleteo`, `edito`, and `addo`.

Format: `Day HH:mm`

All potential natural dates that can be used:
* `Mon HH:mm`
* `Monday HH:mm`
* `Tues HH:mm`
* `Tue HH:mm`
* `Tuesday HH:mm`
* `Weds HH:mm`
* `Wed HH:mm`
* `Wednesday HH:mm`
* `Thurs HH:mm`
* `Thur HH:mm`
* `Thursday HH:mm`
* `Fri HH:mm`
* `Friday HH:mm`
* `Sat HH:mm`
* `Saturday HH:mm`
* `Sun HH:mm`
* `Sunday HH:mm`

Example of natural date:
* `Monday 10:30` or `Mon 10:30` will create a datetime in the form of `dd-mm-yyyy HH:mm` that falls on the closest Monday, where `HH:mm` is `10:30`
* `Sunday 09:30` or `Sun 09:30`will create a datetime in the form of `dd-mm-yyyy HH:mm` that falls on the closest Sunday, where `HH:mm` is `09:30`
* If the current time is `7th April 2022 09:30`, which is a Thursday, inputting `Thurs 08:30` will return `14th April
  2022` as the closest Thursday.
  * Reason: `08:30` has already passed the current time, hence ReadyBakey will look for a future date that is a
    Thursday instead.
* If the current time is `7th April 2022 09:30`, which is a Thursday, inputting `Thurs 09:30` will return `14th April
    2022` as the closest Thursday.
  * Reason: `09:30` has already passed the current time, hence ReadyBakey will look for a future date that is a
    Thursday instead.
* If the current time is `7th April 2022 09:30`, which is a Thursday, inputting `Thurs 10:30` will return `7th April 2022` as the closest Thursday.
  * Reason: `10:30` has not passed the current time, hence ReadyBakey will look at the current day as the closest
    Thursday.

Example of natural dates in action:
* `incompleteo Monday 15:30`
* `addo p/98765432 d/1: Jerry Favourite Cheese Cake c/Tuesday 15:30 m/Delivery r/Add Cheese`

:exclamation: Note: You cannot specify which Natural Date you want. ReadyBakey automatically assigns the closest
Natural Date and it will be shown in the Response Box after the command is executed. (i.e. You cannot specify that
you want the date to be the Monday or any natural date 10 weeks from now)

### Saving the data <a name="saving-data"></a>

ReadyBakey data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file <a name="editing-data"></a>

ReadyBakey data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/readybakey.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ReadyBakey will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
